;; ProbComp Localization Tutorial
;;
;; This notebook aims to give an introduction to probabilistic computation (ProbComp).  This term refers to a way of expressing probabilistic constructs in a computational paradigm, made precise by a probablistic programming language (PPL).  The programmer can thus encode their probabilistic intuition for solving a problem into an algorithm.  Back-end language work automates the routine but error-prone derivations.

;;# The "real world"
;;
;; We assume given
;; * a map of a space, together with
;; * some clutters that sometimes unexpectedly exist in that space.
;;
;; We also assume given a description of a robot's behavior via
;; * an estimated initial pose (= position + heading), and
;; * a program of controls (= advance distance, followed by rotate heading).
;;
;; *In addition to the uncertainty in the initial pose, we are uncertain about the true execution of the motion of the robot.*
;;
;; Below, we will also introduce sensors.

In order to reason about these, we now specify a model using `Gen`.

The `Gen` library provides two DSLs for constructing GFs: the dynamic DSL using the decorator `@gen` on a function declaration, and the static DSL similarly decorated with `@gen (static)`.  The dynamic DSL allows a rather wide class of program structures, whereas the static DSL only allows those for which a certain static analysis may be performed.

Recursively, GFs may sample from other GFs using `~`.

It is very important to be clear about which score/weight/density value is to be expected, and why.  Consider a generative function of two inputs $x,y$ that flips a coin with weight $p$, and accordingly returns $x$ or $y$.  When $x$ and $y$ are unequal, a sensible reporting of the score/weight/density in the sampling process would produce $p$ or $1-p$ accordingly.  If the user supplied equal values $x = y$, then which score/weight/density should be returned?

In this view, the correct score/weight/density would be $1$.  Pursuing this approach for all GFs requires knowlege of all execution histories that might have produced any output, and then performing a sum over them.  For some small finite situations this may be fine, but this general problem of computing marginalizations is computationally impossible.  (More on this elsewhere, below a fold, or in an exercise?)  Therefore, this is ***not the viewpoint of Gen***, and the score/weight/density being introduced here is a ***different number***.

The corresponding mathematical picture imagines GFs as factored into *distributions over choice maps*, whose the score/weight/density is computable, together with deterministic functions on these data that produce the return value from them.  In the toy example, the data of the choice map consists of the sampled Boolean value, its correct score/weight/density is $p$ or $1-p$, accordingly, and its return value function chooses $x$ or $y$, regardless of whether they are equal.

This information arises in the aggregate of the sampled stochastic executions that lead to any return value, together with their weights.  (Check that this is true even in this simple example.)  In a sense, when we kick the can of marginalization down the road, we can proceed without difficulty.

Write $u(\theta) = (\cos\theta, \sin\theta)$ for the unit vector in the direction $\theta$.  We are given a "world" $w$ and "motion settings" parameters $\nu = (\nu_\text p, \nu_\text{hd})$.

Since the primitive distributions of the language are equipped with efficient probability density functions, this overall computation is tractable.  It is represented by `Gen.get_score`:

The the noisy path integration will just be a wrapper around its functionality, extracting what it needs from the trace.

Let's take a look.  (To reduce notebook clutter, we just show the start pose plus the initial 5 timesteps.)

That is, the choice map captures the recursive structure of the stochastic locations of the control flow.

Then `path_model` corresponds to a distribution over traces denoted $\text{path}$; these traces are identified with vectors, namely, $z_{0:T} \sim \text{path}(r_{0:T}, w, \nu)$ is the same as $z_0 \sim \text{init}(r_0, \nu)$ and $z_t \sim \text{step}(z_{t-1}, r_t, w, \nu)$ for $t=1,\ldots,T$.  Here and henceforth we use the shorthand $\text{step}(z, \ldots) := \text{step}(\text{retval}(z), \ldots)$.  The density function is

We could very pass the output of the above `integrate_controls_noisy` to the `plot!` function to have a look at it.  However, we want to get started early in this notebook on a good habit: writing interpretive code for GFs in terms of their traces rather than their return values.  This enables the programmer include the parameters of the model in the display for clarity.

Namely, `Gen.update` takes as inputs a trace, together with modifications to its arguments and primitive choice values, and returns an accordingly modified trace.  It also returns (the log of) the ratio of the output trace's density to the input trace's density, together with a precise record of the resulting modifications to the trace.

This is because in the execution of the model, the only change in the stochastic choices took place where we specified.  In particular, the stochastic choice of pose at the second step was left unchanged.  This choice was typical relative to the first step's heading in the old trace, and while it is not impossible relative to the first step's heading in the new trace, it is *far unlikelier* under the mulitvariate normal distribution supporting it.

This means that the update requires $O(T)$ time, and the above code requires $O(T^2)$ time.

This operation runs in $O(1)$ time, so the outer loop should require only $O(T)$ time.  Gen can intelligently work this way if we encode the structure of Markov chain in this model using a *combinator* for the static DSL, as follows.

Given the parameters of a pose $y$, walls $w$, and settings $\nu$, one gets a distribution $\text{sensor}(y, w, \nu)$ over the traces of `sensor_model`, and when $z$ is a motion model trace we set $\text{sensor}(z, w, \nu) := \text{sensor}(\text{retval}(z), w, \nu)$.  It samples are identified with vectors $o = (o^{(1)}, o^{(2)}, \ldots, o^{(J)})$, where $J := \nu_\text{num\_angles}$, each $o^{(j)}$ independently following a certain normal distribution (depending, notably, on the distance from the pose to the nearest wall).  Thus the density of $o$ factors into a product of the form

Thus the semicolon delimits general parameters.  When parameters are fixed and understood from context, we may delete them and write, say, $P(z)$ or $z \sim P(\cdot)$.

;; It would seem that the fit is reasonable in low motion deviation, but really breaks down in high motion deviation.
;;
;; We are not limited to intuitive judgments here: the model can quantitatively tell us how good a fit it is for the data.  Namely, we can compare the likelihoods of the observation data in typical samples produced by the model, to the likelihoods of our fixed observation data under samples from the model agreeing these data.
;;
;; In order to do this, we detour to explain how to produce samples from our model that agree with the fixed observation data.

;; %% [markdown]
;;## Generating samples with constraints
;;
;; We have seen how `Gen.simulate` performs traced execution of a generative function: as the program runs, it draws stochastic choices from all required primitive distributions, and records them in a choice map.
;;
;; The operation `Gen.generate` performs a generalization of this process.  One also provides a choice map of *constraints* that declare fixed values for some of these primitive choices.  As the program runs, any primitive choice that has been named by the constraints is deterministically given the specified value, and otherwise it is drawn stochastically as in `Gen.simulate`.
;;
;; The trace resulting from a call to `Gen.generate` is indistinguishable from `Gen.simulate`, having the same kind of choice map, in turn having the same assignments of densities to its nodes according to the primitive distributions.  But there is a key situational difference: the total density is *no longer equal to* the frequency with which the trace stochastically occurs under the model.
;;
;; RATIO IS THE IMPORTANCE WEIGHT, EQUALS PROJECT OF CONSTRAINT ADDRESSES IN RESULTING TRACE, AND IS ALSO RETURNED.

;;# Inference: main idea
;;
;; In the viewpoint of ProbComp, the goal of *inference* is to produce *likely* traces of a full model, given the observed data.  In other words, as generative functions induce distributions on traces, and if we view the full model as a program embodying a *prior*, then applying an inference metaprogram to it (together with the observed data) produces a new program that embodies the *posterior*.

;; %% [markdown]
;; Mathematically, the passage from the prior to the posterior is the operation of conditioning distributions.  Namely, one defines first the *marginal distribution* over observations to have density
;; $$
;; P_\text{full}(o_{0:T})
;; := \int P_\text{full}(Z_{0:T}, o_{0:T}) \, dZ_{0:T}
;;  = \mathbf{E}_{Z_{0:T} \sim \text{path}}\big[P_\text{full}(Z_{0:T}, o_{0:T})\big],
;; $$
;; and then the *conditional distribution* has density
;; $$
;; P_\text{full}(z_{0:T} | o_{0:T}) := \frac{P_\text{full}(z_{0:T}, o_{0:T})}{P_\text{full}(o_{0:T})}.
;; $$
;; The goal of inference is to produce samples $\text{trace}_{0:T}$ distributed approximately according to the latter distribution.

;; %% [markdown]
;; Let's show what we mean with a picture.  The following short code, which we treat as a *black box* for the present purposes, very mildly exploits the model structure to bring the samples much closer to the true path.

;;# Generic strategies for inference
;;
;; We now spell out some generic strategies for conditioning the ouputs of our model towards the observed sensor data.  The word "generic" indicates that they make no special intelligent use of the model structure, and their convergence is guaranteed by theorems of a similar nature.
;;
;; There is no free lunch in this game: generic inference recipies are inefficient, for example, converging very slowly or needing vast counts of particles, especially in high-dimensional settings.  Rather, efficiency will later become possible when we exploit what we actually know about the problem in our design of the inference strategy.  Gen's aim is to provide the right entry points to enact this exploitation.

;; %% [markdown]
;;## Deeper functionality of GFs
;;
;; Rif asks: maybe these discussions are too simplified?
;;
;; Traced execution of generative functions, via `Gen.simulate` as seen above, is a straightforward alternative semantic interpretation.  A more refined operation, `Gen.generate`, allows two deeper features.
;;
;; 1. It proposes traces satisfying optional *constraints*.
;; Note that the `get_choices(trace)` returns a tree with nodes at all invokations of `~` to sample from generative functions.  The *leaf* nodes correspond to *primitive choices* coming from honest *distributions*.  Presently, Gen only works with constraints upon these *primitive* choices.  The constraints are recorded in structures called *choice maps*, as modified in the black box code cell above.
;;
;; 2. It returns the proposed trace along with a *(log) weight*, which we then use in our inference strategies.
;; The meaning of this weight is complex:  The trace proposal code need not produce traces with frequencies according to the "actual" distribution represented by the function‚Äîit is allowed to do something simpler and more computationally efficient.  The weight represents any difference between the proposal frequencies and the "actual" frequencies, plus contributions arising from any imposed constraints.
;;
;; Along the same lines, given a trace, one may perform simple modifications of it using `Gen.update` without rerunning the entire GF, and it returns along with the new trace the difference in weights.
