;; ## Simulating a Business

;; `initial-data` contains entries for
;;
;; - `:users`: the starting number of users and
;; - `:cost`: the total amount of advertising spend allocated per time period.

(def initial-data
  {:users 5130
   :cost 33300.0})

;; This configuration holds the initial parameters of the simulation we'll run
;; below.
;;
;; Notice that each entry maps to a slider in the hovering control panel.
;;
;; - `:trials`: total number of simulations to generate
;; - `:periods`: number of time periods to simulate the business
;; - `:free->pay`: percentage of users that convert from free => paid each time period
;; - `:ad-spend-increase`: percentage increase in ad spending per period
;; - `:viral-growth-kicker`: ratio of new viral users to last time period's total new users
;; - `:retention-mean`: average user retention rate, constant per simulation
;; - `:cost-of-service`: total cost to serve a user
;; - `:revenue-per-paying`: revenue per paying customer per time period

;; Let's look at the first 10 time periods of data in table form:

(->table (take 10 simulation))

;; Next, let's look at a chart of total revenue (in blue) and total costs (in
;; red) over time. For the business to be viable, the blue line needs to cross
;; above the red line.

(revenue+cost-chart simulation)

;; The **total value** of the business is the sum of `(- revenue cost)` for all
;; time periods. This particular business is worth the following:

(total-value simulation)

;; ## Simulating Many Trials
;;
;; The following charts are tied to the slider hovering over the page. Play with
;; the sliders and watch the charts update.
;;
;; The first chart shows the revenue+cost chart from above, but tied to the
;; sliders.
;;
;; The next two charts are generated by simulating many businesses and plotting aggregates.

;; The scatterplots show pairs of (random choice, total value) for each type of
;; random choice made by the model.
;;
;; The final chart shows a histogram of total business value generated by all
;; trials.
